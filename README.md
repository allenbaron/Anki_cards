# Anki_cards
The code here extracts help pages from R as html and saves them to a file to be imported into Anki for use as flash cards.

NOTE: The html formatting is important for them to display correctly in Anki.

The code to create cards in Anki will be added.

# Static html Help
Another source to get static help documentation is provided by Yihui Xie, ["Build Static HTML Help Pages for R Packages"](https://yihui.name/en/2012/10/build-static-html-help/). A Stack Overflow question, [R markdown file: include help information](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26480559/r-markdown-file-include-help-information) is also informative.

Too bad I didn't know about these functions before I wrote this repo. It probably would have saved me a lot of time by preventing all the trial-and-error I used to figure out how to extract the documentation.
