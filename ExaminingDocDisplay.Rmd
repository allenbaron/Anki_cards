## Steps I took to determine how R displays help files

First, I tried `debugonce("help")` - then ran `help(abbreviate)` and noticed the final lines of code were: 
    > paths <- unique(paths)
    > attributes(paths) <- list(call = match.call(), topic = topic, 
                              tried_all_packages = tried_all_packages,
                              type = help_type)
    > class(paths) <- "help_files_with_topic"
    > paths

So, I assigned the final `paths` variable to the global environment with
> y <<- paths

Separately, I also tried to bind the help file to a variable:
```{r}
t <- help(abbreviate)
str(t)
```

The output of both `str(y)` and `str(t)` were the same and if I just typed `y` or `t` it would open the manual for `abbreviate`. So, something about the info in this variable was responsible for opening the help manual.

Next, I selectively removed attributes to determine which are required for the help manual to be opened properly. I then called `str(y)` to confirm they were removed and just tried to autoprint `y`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
attr(y, "call") <- NULL
str(y) # help page still opens

attr(y, "topic") <- NULL
str(y) # help page still opens (I thought this would be essential)

attr(y, "type") <- NULL
str(y) # help page does NOT open

attr(y, "class") <- NULL
str(y) # help page does NOT open
```

Somehow, I started to wonder about the class attribute. I thought it might be the most important factor. So, I started rebuilding `y` from scratch for a different function:

```{r}
z <- "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/base/help/acos"
z # just returns the character vector

class(z) <- "help_files_with_topic"
z # returns error
```
`startDynamicHelp()` was apparently the function being called. I examined it's help documentation and saw that it "starts the internal help server, so that HTML help pages are rendered when requested." I tried calling this function without success and saw that it says in `Details` "startDynamicHelp is called by functions that need to use the server, so would rarely be called directly by a user." More reading led me to examine `getOption("help_type")`. I didn't learn much from that, it's set to html, which I want but I didn't know how to follow up from there.

So, I went back to building the function from scratch. Now I knew I needed the "type" attribute.

```{r}
attr(z, "type") <- "html"
z
```

And I needed the "tried_all_packages" attribute.
```{r}
attr(z, "tried_all_packages") <- FALSE
z
```

**AND IT WORKED!!!**
Great.. but now what? Well, I knew I had to figure something out about this class but I wasn't sure how. I tried `??'help_files_with_topic'` to no avail. So, I decided to look at other classes and tried `?character`. I didn't find anything that was super helpful.

At some point I had tried `print(y)` and it opened the manual as expected. So I tried `debug(print)` and `print(y)` to see if I could find something there. All print called was `UseMethod("print")` so I decided to lookup `?UseMethod`.

I've seen a lot about "generic" methods in R but I don't understand too much about them. I know there are S3 and S4 methods but the only other thing I know is S4 are newer and the two types aren't compatible. I noticed in the documentation that it mentioned "methods can be used to find out about the methods for a particular generic function or class."

That got me somewhere.

```{r}
methods(class = "help_files_with_topic")
```

AAAAANNNNNDDDDD... I was back to print but with a hint! So, I opened `?methods` and tried:
```{r}
methods("print")[111] # subset NOW because it's a long list
```

And, then I thought I'd try methods on that:
```{r}
methods("print.help_files_with_topic")
```

That didn't get me anywhere but it seems like this is an S3method and at that point I went back to the documentation for `methods` that was still open. At the bottom I noticed `getS3method`. So I lloked that up (`?getS3method`) and then tried:

```{r eval = FALSE}
getS3method("print", "help_files_with_topic")
```
And that brought up _A LOT_ of source code for `print`, which I'm not showing here. Now time for first person... hahaha.

**What does the code do (I'll recreate it as I go through):**

- It sets a `browser` variable and copies the topic and type attributes from the print input (an object 'x' of class "help_files_with_topic") and converts the input to a character vector named `paths`.
```{r}
x <- t
browser <- getOption("browser")
topic <- attr(x, "topic")
type <- attr(x, "type")
paths <- as.character(x)
```

- It sets the variable `port <- tools::startDynamicHelp(NA)` so that can be opened later.
```{r}
port <- tools::startDynamicHelp(NA)
```

- It sets `file <- paths` (if `length(paths) == 1`).
```{r}
file <- paths
```

- It verifies `type == "html"` and checks if `port > 0L`. Lets look back at `port` and find out what it does:
```{r}
port
port > 0L
```
`port` actually opens a port on the computer. This may be useful. I'll probably come back to it. And, the logical expression evaluates to `TRUE` so... 

- It sets a bunch of variables as follows:
```{r}
path <- dirname(file)
dirpath <- dirname(path)
pkgname <- basename(dirpath)

path
dirpath
pkgname
```

- And then calls `browseURL` as follows:
```{r}
browseURL(paste0("http://127.0.0.1:", port, "/library/", 
                  pkgname, "/html/", basename(file), ".html"), 
                  browser)
```

And that opens the help file. Okay, so to get back to what I was working on yesterday I probably just need to call `read_html()` from the `rvest` package using `port` as bound here with `tools::startDynamicHelp(NA)` and it should work. Let's try it.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rvest)
helpfile <- read_html(paste0("http://127.0.0.1:", port, "/library/", 
                  pkgname, "/html/", basename(file), ".html"))
helpfile
```

Okay, for some reason that stalls. I'm going to look back at my work from 2 days ago and see if I can fix this. I tried just inputing that `port` into where the previous one was in my **Rfunctions_Anki.R** script and it ended up hanging again. Maybe I can wrap `browserURL` in `read_html`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
helpfile <- read_html(browseURL(paste0("http://127.0.0.1:", port, "/library/", 
                  pkgname, "/html/", basename(file), ".html"), 
                  browser))
```

Nope, that didn't work. It gave me an error.

Maybe my problem is that today I'm opening the wrong kind of port. I wish I could remember how I displayed the help files in Chrome 2 days ago. Back to that...

Okay, I tried opening the "00Index.html" file for `dplyr`. It opens in Chrome but as a file and I can't access the functions listed in it. I also tried dragging that file onto Chrome which had the same effect. I tried right-clicking on the `as.character` link found in the manual for `abbreviate`, copying it and pasting it into Chrome. That gave me the URL in the correct format but I got an "access was denied" error.

Hmmm... I'm going to try `browser` again. Hey, it's a function. Time to try something new:
```{r}
browser(paste0("http://127.0.0.1:", port, "/library/",
               pkgname, "/html/", basename(file), ".html"))
```

That opened the help file for abbreviate strings. Maybe I can wrap that in `read_html`.

```{r}
helpfile <- read_html(browser(paste0("http://127.0.0.1:", port, "/library/",
               pkgname, "/html/", basename(file), ".html")))
```

Nope, same error. Maybe I can wrap the whole thing in `read_html` (I clearly don't understand what constitutes a "connection"... sheesh). Oh... hahaha. I already tried that. Nevermind. Hmm....

No luck googling "port 11435 computer mac" or "R port computer". Okay, I noticed that if `type == text` `print.help_files_with_topic` does something else. Maybe I can try to specify a type and export all the help files as text files and then delete them afterward. I probably would have to specify this in `help()`. Time to look at `?help`... yep. Okay, let's do this.

```{r}
help(abbreviate, help_type = "text")
```
Hmm.... that opened a new file in RStudio labelled "R Help on 'abbreviate'" but it's blank. Looking back at the S3 print method it looks like that calls

> pkgname <- basename(dirname(dirname(file)))
> temp <- tools::Rd2txt(.getHelpFile(file), out = tempfile("Rtxt"), 
                package = pkgname)
> file.show(temp, title = gettextf("R Help on %s", 
                sQuote(topic)), delete.file = TRUE)

So, let's see. `?Rd2txt` looks like it's using `.getHelpFile(file)` as the Rd file. It's similar to `Rd2HTML` so maybe I can use that. I can't access any info or run `.getHelpFile` so I'll try binding the `temp` variable as above.

```{r}
temp <- tools::Rd2txt(.getHelpFile(file), out = tempfile("Rtxt"), 
                package = pkgname)
```

Nope. How about googling ".getHelpFile". I found a [webpage](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/printing-html-help-to-the-terminal-td2313801.html) that might work. Let's look at what they suggest.

```{r}
page <- utils:::.getHelpFile(?print) # remember to keep that question mark!), and use 
tools::Rd2HTML(page) 
```

SUCCESS!!! Now let's try that for a function I'm familiar with `abbreviate`.

```{r}
page <- utils:::.getHelpFile(?abbreviate) 
tools::Rd2HTML(page)
```

Okay. I'll just extract the pertinent html info I want for Anki and I'll be set!

** UPDATE: Feb 9, 2017 **
I read in documentation ??`:::` that this syntax should not be used (except to examine an internal named argument), so I thought I'd examine what this does.

I checked the source code for `utils:::.getHelpFile` and saw that it basically extracts the location of the help doc (input from `help()`) and then calls `tools:::fetchRdDB` (with `filebase = <pkg dir>` and `key = <fxn name>`). Looking at it's source code, it makes use of a custom function wrapping `lazyLoadDBfetch` and then `lazyLoadDBexec()` to execute that function in the `filebase` dir. The help for these functions specify they shouldn't be called either and are only meant for internal R use, so I'm just going to stick with what worked and not try to recreate these functions.


## Other approaches I attempted/am aware of

1. While I was examining the attributes of `y` I also noticed info suggesting help files were opened with `browseURL()`. I tried using the path "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/base/help/abbreviate"as an argument but nothing happened. Then, I thought maybe I could change the default browser to some output I could use so I examined `getOption("browser")` but I thought this was a long shot and didn't understand much since it appears to access precompiled code using `.Call` (see `?.Call`).

2. I read online about `R CMD Rdconv` and similar code that could be used at the command line but for some reason I couldn't even get R to open. I learned that had something do with the `$PATH` which I could look up with `echo $PATH` in bash. My path had Python in it but nothing for R. After some internet searching I found [this](http://hathaway.cc/post/69201163472/how-to-edit-your-path-environment-variables-on-mac) and was able to add R to my `$PATH`. Now R commands work. I looked up the help to `R CMD Rdconv` by appending `--help` but the real problem is I can't find the .Rd file. They're probably stored in .rdb (and maybe .rdx) which are binaries.
